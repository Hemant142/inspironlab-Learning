    <h1>View Provider Component</h1>
    <p>This component demonstrates the use of view providers in Angular.</p>
    <p>View providers are used to create a new instance of a service for each component view.</p>
    <p>This means that each component can have its own instance of a service, which can be useful for managing state and behavior.</p>
